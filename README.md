# cv_dl_tasks - list of tasks based on computer vision and deep learning methods.

#### Description
I will add to this repository different application tasks with description and comments. 
It can be basic explanations or examples of solutions to real cases.

#### Structure
Each of tasks include code and description inside jupyter notebook or python script file.
This jupyter/python file and other additional files such as images, python script etc. included in task subdirectory.

#### How two use
Install anaconda (conda 4.8.3) and use requirements.txt for installation requirements

###### Requirements
- opencv >= 4.1.0
- tensorflow-gpu == 2.1.0
- matplotlib == 3.1.3 
- pydot=1.4.1
- graphviz=2.40.1
- jupyterlab=2.1.1

For installation use requirements.txt (Anaconda).

#### Tasks list
**1. simple_cnn_model - basic CNN model with tensorflow2 keras api.**

In this task we will analyze basic CNN model, 
layers included at this model, see how to use datasets included into tensorflow and work with them,
try to train our lenet-5 model with preprocessed dataset.
